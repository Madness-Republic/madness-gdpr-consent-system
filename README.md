# Madness GDPR Consent System
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.3.2-orange.svg)

Lightweight, dependency-free, and modular GDPR Cookie Consent system with multi-language support, Admin Panel, and Proof of Consent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **LEGAL DISCLAIMER**: Use of this module does not automatically guarantee GDPR compliance. Compliance depends on the entire site configuration, privacy policy, and data handling practices. The author assumes NO responsibility for fines, damages, or disputes arising from the use of this software. Always consult with a legal expert.

## Features
- **Strict Compliance (Basic Mode)**: Blocks Google Analytics and third-party scripts totally until explicit consent is given (satisfies Cookiebot/Iubenda scanners).
- **Proof of Consent Logging**: Server-side CSV logging of consent actions (Timestamp, Masked IP, Consent ID) for legal compliance.
- **Auto-Installation**: One-click banner injection for non-technical users.
- **Equal Prominence UI**: Compliant design with identical "Accept" and "Reject" buttons to avoid "dark patterns".
- **Google Consent Mode v2**: Full support for both Basic and Advanced GCM v2 signals.
- **Generic Script Blocking**: Easily block any 3rd party script (Pixel, LinkedIn, etc.) using `type="text/plain"`.
- **Dynamic Language Support**: Multi-language support out of the box (IT, EN, ES, etc.).
- **Admin Panel**: Full control over settings, styles, and policy content without touching code.
- **System Self-Test**: Built-in tool to verify server environment, folder permissions, and security settings with one-click "Auto-Fix" for missing protections.
- **Security Hardening**: Admin passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt (password_hash), and security warnings alert admins if they are using default credentials.
- **Apache License 2.0**: Open-source license that provides stronger legal protection and explicit indemnity for the author.
- **Universal Integration**: Automatically handles paths to work from root or subdirectories (e.g., `/pixelwall/`). Supports custom Privacy Policy paths via configuration.

## Installation

1. Create a folder named `gdpr` in your website's root directory and upload all the repository files into it.
   *Note: The system is designed to run from within the `/gdpr/` directory.*
2. Ensure `gdpr/logs/` has write permissions (chmod 755/775).
3. Access the Admin Panel at yourdomain.com/gdpr/dashboard/index.php (Default password: `admin`).
    *   *Security Note: Change the password immediately in settings.*
4. Configure your settings (Company info, GA4 ID, Enabled Languages).
5. Include the banner in your main layout file (e.g., `footer.php` or `index.php` before `</body>`):
   ```php
   <?php include_once 'gdpr/banner.php'; ?>
   ```
6. **Run System Check**: Login to the dashboard, go to the top bar, and click **🔍 System Check**. Fix any reported errors (red marks) to ensure logs are protected and writable.

## Usage

### Third-Party Script Blocking
For scripts that don't support Consent Mode (like Facebook Pixel), modify the tag:
```html
<script type="text/plain" data-category="marketing">
  // Your tracking code
</script>
```

### Admin Panel
The admin panel (`gdpr/dashboard/index.php`) allows you to:
- Manage **Company Data** (automatically injected into policies).
- Toggle **Google Analytics 4** integration.
- Configure **Custom Privacy Policy URL** for dynamic linking.
- Enable/Disable supported languages.
- Customize **Banner Texts** for each language.
- Edit **Privacy & Cookie Policy** templates.
- Adjust **Styles & Colors** with live preview and **Equal Prominence** enforcement.

### Proof of Consent
Consent logs are stored daily in `gdpr/logs/` as CSV files. These logs are protected by an `.htaccess` file and contain anonymized data to prove compliance during audits.

### Policy Templates Warning
> [!WARNING]
> The HTML templates provided in the `gdpr/content/` folder (Privacy & Cookie Policy) are **generic examples** only. You **must** review, edit, and validate them with your legal counsel to ensure they accurately reflect your specific data treatments and local regulations.

## CSS Customization
The system uses CSS variables. You can override them in your main CSS:
```css
:root {
    --gdpr-primary: #f09100;
    --gdpr-btn-accept-1: #f09100;
    --gdpr-btn-accept-2: #ff4d4d;
}
```
